<figcaption style="color:lightgray;text-align:center;"> Can our government truly keep us safe? </figcaption>
<h2 style="color:darkgrey;text-align: center;font-family: 'Rajdhani', sans-serif;"> Often times, our government is said to be protecting the people of their country with trained, strong soliders. Despite all of the glory, there are other things that can hurt us being the cilivians. The Dark Web- that is if indiviuals tries to get on there. </h2>
  <h3 class="header"> Is it illegal? </h1>
  <p class="para"> No, it is not illegal to be on the darkweb, that is why so many people has been on the darkweb for multiple purposes. Using softwares like Tor won't get you in trouble. However, what is illegal is performing illegal activties and buying illegal activities. Or even hacking things without any permission to. The usual rules still applies when it comes to the darkweb. The darkweb gives extreme privacy protection against the surveillance of authoritarian governments. Allowing the it to continue growing and the gathering of sick, insane, disturbing people. The dark web is a lifeline that provides access to information and protection from persecution. Although it may seems horrendious, it is a safe place for people who feels insecure with government tracking every activities they do. </p>
  <h3 class="header"> What has been done? </h1>
  <p class="para"> The name for the main parts of the darkweb where illicit items are sold, and performed are what they call "Silk Road hub." The name sounds familar, it sounds like our history's famous Silk roads. Authorities has actually taken it down and arrested the owner of the Silk Road hub. Although it has been rebuilt once before, the authorities has managed to take it down the second time and captured it's lieutenant. This might seem like the only place for darkweb silk road. But there are also others that has the same concepts and hubs like this one that hasn't been tracked down yet.  </p>
  <h3 class="header"> What should be done? </h1>
  <p class="para"> There should be more advanced programmers that have been trained that works for the government. That way, the government will have some sort of protection system when it comes to the time where dangerous people like people on the darkweb will attack. There also should be some sort of internet polices that are anonymous so that they don't risk their lives sitting in front of a computer trying to protect the citizens. Since the cryptocurrencies are untraceable, it makes it alot harder for authorities to manage. Because of that, people all around the world, specifically authorities should montior them cautiously while also not putting themselves in danger. </p>
  <h3 class="ending"> Being that said, our government is trying their best to try and keep the people safe online. <b> But </b> it <i> isn't enough. </i> There are people who don't want to obey them and wants to put themselves out there to fulfil their curiousities. In which there is no judgments to them, it is their life. If they ever want to though, they should think twice before doing so. <u>What do you think?</u> </h3>

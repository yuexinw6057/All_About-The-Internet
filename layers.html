   <h3 class="center">There are many misconceptions about the dark web and the deep web. Continue on to find out! </h3>
   <h2 class="sub" id="internet"> The surface web </h2>
   <p class="para">  Many of us, like you and me are on the surface web, doing different things like reading this blog, on youtube, watching anime, and etc. It is one of the places to go to online when you are bored at home. Either doing your work or just chilling. The Surface Web only consists of 10 percent of the information that is on the internet. The Surface Web is made with a collection of public Web pages on a server accessible by any search engine. </p>
   <h2 class="sub"> The deep web </h2>
   <p class="para"> The deep web is different from the Dark web! People get it confused all the time! It is completely different! The deep web refers to all the pages which are not indexed. Meaining that most search engines won’t return them to you after a search. It is also a place where people's informations are stored securely and legally. Things such as academic records, doctors' informations, banks and etc. In order to access one of these pages, you need to either know their exact link or you clicking on another link once you get in the deep side of the web. The deep web can also include significant parts of the legitimate, mainstream web (like Netflix or shopping websites), simply because they are personalized for users and not all URLs are meant to be the same link.
 </p>
   <h2 class="sub" id="darkweb"> The dark web </h2>
   <p class="para"> The dark web is a layer even deeper- technically also part of the deep web, but more deep. The dark web is a place where you don't want to be. This place is full of illegal activities and trafficking. There is no way to get there on a surface web. However, web browsers like Tor allows you to access with no difficulties. Tor allows you to hide your ip addresses <b> most </b> of the time. But there are always people who are better than the software you are using.  </p>
   <h4 class="sub"> So...what is <i> exactly </i> on the darkweb? <i class="small"> <b class="red"> (sensitivity trigger, <u> <a href="#skip" class="skip">skip</a></u> this list if sensitive) </i> </b> </h4>
   <p class="listheader"> The Dark Web Consists Of: </p>
   <ul> 
     <li> Marketplace for various drugs, from mild recreational and borderline legal ones (like weed) </li>
     <li> Marketplace for various fire weapons and ammunitions; unregistered </li>
     <li> Lists of other deep web / dark web websites and their links </li>
     <li> Websites with videos depicting abuse towards children, animals, war prisoners etc </li>
     <li> Child Pornography </li>
     <li> Racist content and content promoting violence against various minorities </li>
     <li> Recipes on how to cook human meat and video footage </li>
     <li> Marketplace for hiring hitmen  </li>
   </ul>
   <h3 class="listheader2" id="skip"> The lists goes on and on and more disturbing. Therefore, I will stop it here. </h3>
   <h3 class="sub"> Conclusion </h3>
   <p class="para"> A lot of times, these two terms gets used confusingly, but the deep web just refers to non-recorded pages, while the dark web refers to pages which are both non-indexed and involved in illegal activites. The iceberg in the beginning is used as a metaphor to show how deep the dark web is. Despite their names, always remember that <b> <i> the dark web is deeper than the deep web. </b> </i> The deep web is generally neutral, it can be used for good or for bad. The dark web is where the people who lack morals come together. </p>
   <p class="fact">
   <b> Dark Fact! </b> </p>
   <p class="para">
   Dark web website addresses end with .onion instead of the surface web’s .com, .org, or .gov. They use something call the onion router so that they don't get tracked with anything. Especially the IP addresses. </p>

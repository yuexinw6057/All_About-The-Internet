<h2 class="center2"> Hello! First things first, my name is Kayla Weng and I am the creator of this website! I am a high school student. This website is <b class="red"> NOT </b> meant to motivate anyone to go on the darkweb in any sort :) <br> Here you will be looking at: </h2>

<h3 class="purpose"> 
  The purpose of this website is to educate people about the internet. Specifically the dark web. There are many people in this world that has curiousity. Inluding myself. Although I have not gone to the dark web and I will not go to the dark web for any reason, some people have and they put themselves at a really high risk doing so. As they all say, curosity kills the cat. By spreading awareness, we can prevent people from getting hacked or even killed. <i> This is <b> NOT </b> a website for people to motivate people to go on the darkweb in any way. </i> But of course,I can't control you just like nobody can (except maybe your parents). If you ever get curious, go to youtube. There is everything you can think of there. And even if you still want to fulfil your curiousity, proceed with risks in your mind. There will always be people watching and people who are higher level than you.

<h1 style= "font-family: 'Rock Salt', cursive;" class="motivation"> Motivation! </h1>
<h3 class="motistyle"> The reason why I started this website was because of a school project that I had to do. And believe me, I am the master of procrastination. Creating a website isn't as simple as it sounds like. Especially when it comes to motivation. My main motivation is me thinking to myself that after I finish this website, I feel proud of it. And shout out to the people that cheered up on me doing this website!  </h3>
